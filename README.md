### Overview

This is the code that powers https://resilience-rust.vercel.app/

Briefly, the goal is to identify "dead zones" or areas that are underutilized
and identify and visualize opportunities for repurposing those areas to better
help the environment.

To run locally, use the following command from the root of the repo:
`python app.py`

### TODO

- add areas besides parking lots
- clean up feature set
- create a simple model to assign remedies based on features
- create a simple model to quantify opportunities
- use correct marker and region colors based on model outputs
